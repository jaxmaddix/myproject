## Selection factors
* leaf type (based on current fungus needs?)
* chemical
* leaf age

## Selection farther from colony
* decisions made at/near tree
* observations at La Cotinga
* trails can be hundreds of meters long

## To Do
* get Kiki's data for comparison to un-rejected leaves
* look at videos
* figure out what species it was
